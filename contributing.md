# CONTRIBUTING

Hi fellow developers and users, thank you for considering our package `nepali` for your needs.

Reading and following these guidelines will help us make the contribution process easy and effective for everyone involved. It also communicates that you agree to respect the time of the developers managing and developing these open source projects. In return, we will reciprocate that respect by addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

## Getting Started
Contributions are made to this repo via Issues and Pull Requests (PRs). A few general guidelines that cover both:
* Search for existing Issues and PRs before creating your own.
* We will make sure to address any issues reported as soon as possible.

### Issues
Issues should be used to report problems with the library, request a new feature, or to discuss potential changes before a PR is created.

_TODO: Add issues template_

If you find an Issue that addresses the problem you're having, please add your own reproduction information to the existing issue rather than creating a new one. Adding a [reaction](https://github.blog/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/) can also help be indicating to our maintainers that a particular problem is affecting more than just the reporter.

### Pull Requests
PRs to our libraries are always welcome and can be a quick way to get your fix or improvement. In general, PRs should:
* Only fix/add the functionality in question.
* Address a single concern in the least number of changed lines as possible.

_TODO: Add unit tests_

_TODO: Add PR template_

For changes that address core functionality or would require breaking changes, it's best to open an Issue to discuss your proposal first. This is not required but can save time creating and reviewing changes.

In general, we follow the ["fork-and-pull" Git workflow](https://github.com/susam/gitpr)
1. Fork the repository to your own Github account
2. Clone the project to your machine
3. Create a branch locally with a succinct but descriptive name
4. Commit changes to the branch
5. Following any formatting and testing guidelines specific to this repo
6. Push changes to your fork
7. Open a PR in our repository and we'll review the changes.
